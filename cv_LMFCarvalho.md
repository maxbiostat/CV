Summary {#summary .unnumbered}
=======

Natural biological processes emit signals, which are often too loud or
too low for us to “hear”. My goal as a scientist is to develop and apply
statistical and mathematical tools to decode and quantify these
biological signals, specially those imprinted in pathogens’ – and their
hosts’ – genomes. I hope a better understanding of these entities can
contribute to the general theory of Biology and also lead to a
progressive reduction of the world’s disease burden.

I have a broad range of interests in quantitative biology, from complex
networks to spatial analysis to statistical phylogenetics. Nevertheless,
my main scientific interest is to understand the complex interaction
between rapidly evolving pathogens, such as <span>RNA</span> viruses,
and their hosts. I have published peer-reviewed papers in indexed
international journals, such as *Infection, Genetics and Evolution*,
*Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene* and
*BMC Bioinformatics*. I have also attended to or had work presented at
national and international conferences, such as the Brazilian Congress
of Virology, the Brazilian Congress of Epidemiology, the International
BioInformatics Workshop on Virus Evolution and Molecular Epidemiology
and the Gordon Research Conference on Biology of Host-Parasite
Interactions.

As you will notice if you continue reading, I am a big fan of
collaboration, interacting with colleagues around Brazil and abroad. My
current interests are:

-   Phylogeny estimation: branch lengths in time-trees and MCMC
    exploration of the tree space;

-   Coupling mathematical models to coalescent-based population
    reconstructions;

-   Bayesian inference of deterministic models;

-   Incorporating geographic structure (neighbourhood, natural barriers,
    etc.) into CMTC-based phylogeographic diffusion models (check
    <https://github.com/maxbiostat/PhylogeographeR>);

-   Applying complex networks to data mining and vizualization in large
    genomic databases;

Please feel free to contact me if your interests lie anywhere near these
topics.
